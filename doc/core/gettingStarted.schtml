Prerequisites: Java, Git, Unix (linux or mac)

Get the StrataCode command and runtime:

    git clone --depth=1 ssh://vsgit@stratacode.com/home/git/vs/dist

Get the StrataCode layers: frameworks, libraries, samples, tests:

    git clone ssh://vsgit@stratacode.com/home/git/vs/layers

If you are curious, get the StrataCode source code itself:

    git clone ssh://vsgit@stratacode.com/home/git/vs/stratacode

Put the dist/bin folder in your path.  Change to the layers folder, the folder created when you ran the second git clone and run:

    sc editor/swing/main

to start the editor.  Or run:

    sc editor/swing/main example/expertSystem/main

to run the editor with an application.  If you have problems, first try adding the '-a' option to do a clean build.  There's a usage for the sc command and also help availably at the command with "help".
